## Description

In this assignment, I built an application that generates a README file. The application does all the generating from the terminal. We used a javascript file to ask the user questions, then we recorded the answers of the user's responses. Holding those answers, we then made a stock readme with general text. With that text, we then filled in the blanks with the user's unique answers and, finally, generated the professional and personalized README.

## Installation

Run the command "npm init -y" to generate our starting node modules. Then run "npm install inquirer@8.2.4" to install the inquirer.

In this block of code, I set rules for the app to develop a license section or not. If the license section is built, then we add the badge and link to the license website.
